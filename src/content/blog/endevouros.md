I used to distro hop. A lot.

From Ubuntu to Fedora, Arch, Garuda, CachyOS, and more — I was constantly chasing the “perfect distro”. Sometimes it was for performance, sometimes for aesthetics, but most of the time, I didn’t even know what I was looking for.

Until I realized the one thing that actually mattered to me:  
**rolling release**.

### 🔄 Why Rolling Release Matters to Me

I want my system to be up-to-date — always.  
I don’t want to reinstall or wait 6 months for the latest software. I want to use the newest kernel, the latest packages, and bleeding-edge features without fighting with legacy versions.

And for that, **rolling release** is a must.

### 🚀 Why I Chose EndeavourOS

After testing so many distros, I found that EndeavourOS gave me everything I wanted:

- Based on **Arch Linux**, but easier to install
- **Rolling release** out of the box
- Minimal bloat — I can uninstall what I don't need
- Access to **pacman**, **yay**, and the full power of the **AUR**
- KDE Plasma runs smooth, fast, and beautiful
- Great community and documentation

In short, it's Arch — without the pain of manually setting everything up.

### 🧘‍♂️ The End of Distro Hopping?

Well… let’s just say I’m at peace. For now.

EndeavourOS gives me stability _and_ modern features. I can update daily, customize freely, and focus on what I actually want to do — instead of constantly reinstalling my system.

_If you're tired of hopping from distro to distro and just want something that works — with rolling release power — give EndeavourOS a try. It might just become your last hop._
